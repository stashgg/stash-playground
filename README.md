## About the Stash Playground

This repo contains various framework examples you can use with Stash. There are frontend, backend, and game SDK examples. Stash regularly adds to and updates this repo. If you have any issues with a code example, or want to see other examples, please let us know!

## How to use the Stash Plaground

Each section in this repo has its own ReadMe. They provide general information about the examples, prerequisites, etc. You can clone the entire repo or copy and paste examples as needed.

## SDK examples

Stash provides Unity and Unreal SDKs for working with our APIs. This means you can build Stash functionality into the same project you build your game in.

## Backend examples

Some Stash integrations require you to build backend APIs. These are often for approving and processing purchases. The backend examples cover different frameworks for building these APIs and integrating with Stash. It's possible you have related logic in place already.

## Frontend examples
